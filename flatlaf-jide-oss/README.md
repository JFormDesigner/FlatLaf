FlatLaf addon for JIDE Common Layer
===================================

This addon for FlatLaf adds support for **some**
[JIDE Common Layer](https://github.com/jidesoft/jide-oss) components.

Following JIDE Common Layer components are currently supported by this addon:

- `JidePopupMenu`
- `JideTabbedPane`
- `RangeSlider`
- `TristateCheckBox`


**Note**: We have currently no plans to support additional components. If you're
a paid customer of JFormDesigner and need support for other components, email to
JFormDesigner support and ask for it. Otherwise, try to implement it yourself
and create a pull request.
