FlatLaf Change Log
==================

## 3.7-SNAPSHOT

#### New features and improvements

- If using `FlatLaf.registerCustomDefaultsSource( "com.myapp.themes" )` and
  named Java modules, it is no longer necessary to add `opens com.myapp.themes;`
  to `module-info.java`. (issue #1026)
- Extras: Made animated theme change (class `FlatAnimatedLafChange`) smoother.

#### Fixed bugs

- Tree and List: Fixed painting of rounded drop backgrounds. (issue #1023)
- Popup: Showing tooltip in inactive window brought that window to front (made
  it active) and potentially hid the previously active window. (issue #1037)
- macOS: Fixed window "flashing" when switching from a light to a dark theme (or
  vice versa). Especially when using animated theme changer (see
  [FlatLaf Extras](flatlaf-extras)).

#### Incompatibilities

- FlatLaf properties files are now loaded using the UTF-8 character encoding
  instead of ISO 8859-1. In usual properties files you will not notice any
  difference because they use only ASCII characters, but if you've put localized
  (non-English) texts (e.g. German umlauts) into your properties files, you need
  to convert them to UTF-8. Properties files created with the FlatLaf Theme
  Editor already use UTF-8, including in older versions. (issue #1031)


## 3.6.1

- Extras: Support JSVG 2.0.0. Minimum JSVG version is now 1.6.0. (issue #997)
- FlatLaf window decorations (Windows 10/11 only): Improved diagonal window
  resizing on top-left and top-right window corners. Top window resize area now
  also covers iconify/maximize/close buttons. (issue #1015)
- ToggleButton: Styling `selectedForeground` did not work if `foreground` is
  also styled. (issue #1017)
- JideSplitButton: Fixed updating popup when switching theme. (issue #1000)
- IntelliJ Themes: Fixed logging false errors when loading 3rd party
  `.theme.json` files. (issue #990)
- Linux: Popups appeared in wrong position on multi-screen setup if primary
  display is located below or right to secondary display. (see
  [NetBeans issue #8532](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/8532))
- macOS: Fixed popup flickering after theme change. (issue #1009)
- macOS with JetBrains Runtime: Fixed sometimes empty popups. (issue #1019)


## 3.6

#### New features and improvements

- macOS: Re-enabled rounded popup border (see PR #772) on macOS 14.4+ (was
  disabled in 3.5.x).
- Increased contrast of text for better readability: (PR #972; issue #762)
  - In **FlatLaf Dark**, **FlatLaf Darcula** and many dark IntelliJ themes, made
    all text colors brighter.
  - In **FlatLaf Light**, **FlatLaf IntelliJ** and many light IntelliJ themes,
    made disabled text colors slightly darker.
  - In **FlatLaf macOS Light**, made disabled text colors darker.
  - In **FlatLaf macOS Dark**, made text colors of "default" button and selected
    ToggleButton lighter.
- CheckBox: Support styling indeterminate state of
  [tri-state check boxes](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.formdev/flatlaf-extras/latest/com/formdev/flatlaf/extras/components/FlatTriStateCheckBox.html).
  (PR #936; issue #919)
- List: Support for alternate row highlighting. (PR #939)
- Tree: Support for alternate row highlighting. (PR #903)
- Tree: Support wide cell renderer. (issue #922)
- ScrollBar: Use rounded thumb also on Windows (as on macOS and Linux) and made
  thumb slightly darker/lighter. (issue #918)
- Extras: `FlatSVGIcon` color filters now can access painting component to
  implement component state based color mappings. (issue #906)
- Linux:
  - Rounded iconify/maximize/close buttons if using FlatLaf window decorations.
    (PR #971)
  - Added `libflatlaf-linux-arm64.so` for Linux on ARM64. (issue #899)
  - Use X11 window manager events to resize window, if FlatLaf window
    decorations are enabled. This gives FlatLaf windows a more "native" feeling.
    (issue #866)
- IntelliJ Themes:
  - Updated to latest versions and fixed various issues.
  - Support customizing through properties files. (issue #824)
- SwingX: Support `JXTipOfTheDay` component. (issue #980)
- Support key prefixes for Linux desktop environments (e.g. `[gnome]`, `[kde]`
  or `[xfce]`) in properties files. (issue #974)
- Support custom key prefixes (e.g. `[win10]` or `[test]`) in properties files.
  (issue #649)
- Support multi-prefixed keys (e.g. `[dark][gnome]TitlePane.buttonBackground`).
  The value is only used if all prefixes match current platform/theme.
- Support new component border color to indicate success state (set client
  property `JComponent.outline` to `success`). (PR #982, issue #945)
- Fonts: Updated **Inter** to
  [v4.1](https://github.com/rsms/inter/releases/tag/v4.1).

#### Fixed bugs

- Button: Fixed background and foreground colors for `borderless` and
  `toolBarButton` style default buttons (`JButton.isDefaultButton()` is `true`).
  (issue #947)
- FileChooser: Improved performance when navigating to large directories with
  thousands of files. (issue #953)
- PopupFactory: Fixed NPE on Windows 10 when `owner` is `null`. (issue #952)
- Popup: On Windows 10, drop shadow of heavy-weight popup was not updated if
  popup moved/resized. (issue #942)
- FlatLaf window decorations:
  - Minimize and maximize icons were not shown for custom scale factors less
    than 100% (e.g. `-Dflatlaf.uiScale=75%`). (issue #951)
  - Linux: Fixed occasional maximizing of window when single-clicking the
    window's title bar. (issue #637)
- Styling: MigLayout visual padding was not updated after applying style to
  Button, ComboBox, Spinner, TextField (and subclasses) and ToggleButton. (issue
  #965)
- Linux: Popups (menus and combobox lists) were not hidden when window is moved,
  resized, maximized, restored, iconified or switched to another window. (issue
  #962)
- Fixed loading FlatLaf UI delegate classes when using FlatLaf in special
  application where multiple class loaders are involved. E.g. in Eclipse plugin
  or in LibreOffice extension. (issues #955 and #851)
- HTML: Fixed rendering of `<hr noshade>` in dark themes. (issue #932)
- TextComponents: `selectAllOnFocusPolicy` related changes:
  - No longer select all text if selection (or caret position) was changed by
    application and `selectAllOnFocusPolicy` is `once` (the default). (issue
    #983)
  - FormattedTextField and Spinner: `selectAllOnFocusPolicy = once` behaves now
    as `always` (was `never` before), which means that all text is selected when
    component gains focus. This is because of special behavior of
    `JFormattedTextField` that did not allow implementation of `once`.
  - Client property `JTextField.selectAllOnFocusPolicy` now also works on
    (editable) `JComboBox` and on `JSpinner`.
  - Added client property `JTextField.selectAllOnMouseClick` to override UI
    property `TextComponent.selectAllOnMouseClick`. (issue #961)
  - For `selectAllOnMouseClick = true`, clicking with the mouse into the text
    field, to focus it, now always selects all text, even if
    `selectAllOnFocusPolicy` is `once`.

#### Incompatibilities

- IntelliJ Themes:
  - Theme prefix in `IntelliJTheme$ThemeLaf.properties` changed from
    `[theme-name]` to `{theme-name}`.
  - Renamed classes in package
    `com.formdev.flatlaf.intellijthemes.materialthemeuilite` from `Flat<theme>`
    to `FlatMT<theme>`.
  - Removed `Gruvbox Dark Medium` and `Gruvbox Dark Soft` themes.
- Prefixed keys in properties files (e.g. `[dark]Button.background` or
  `[win]Button.arc`) are now handled earlier than before. In previous versions,
  prefixed keys always had higher priority than unprefixed keys and did always
  overwrite unprefixed keys. Now prefixed keys are handled in same order as
  unprefixed keys, which means that if a key is prefixed and unprefixed (e.g.
  `[win]Button.arc` and `Button.arc`), the one which is last specified in
  properties file is used.\
  Following worked in previous versions, but now `Button.arc` is always `6`:
  ~~~properties
  [win]Button.arc = 12
  Button.arc = 6
  ~~~
  This works in new (and old) versions:
  ~~~properties
  Button.arc = 6
  [win]Button.arc = 12
  ~~~


## 3.5.4

#### Fixed bugs

- HTML: Fixed NPE when using HTML text on a component with `null` font. (issue
  #930; PR #931; regression in 3.5)
- Linux: Fixed NPE when using FlatLaf window decorations and switching theme.
  (issue #933; regression in 3.5.3)


## 3.5.3

#### Fixed bugs

- HTML: Fixed wrong rendering if HTML text contains `<style>` tag with
  attributes (e.g. `<style type='text/css'>`). (issue #905; regression in 3.5.1)
- FlatLaf window decorations:
  - Windows: Fixed possible deadlock with TabbedPane in window title area in
    "full window content" mode. (issue #909)
  - Windows: Fixed wrong layout in maximized frame after changing screen scale
    factor. (issue #904)
  - Linux: Fixed continuous cursor toggling between resize and standard cursor
    when resizing window. (issue #907)
  - Fixed sometimes broken window moving with SplitPane in window title area in
    "full window content" mode. (issue #926)
- Popup: On Windows 10, fixed misplaced popup drop shadow. (issue #911;
  regression in 3.5)
- Popup: Fixed NPE if `GraphicsConfiguration` is `null` on Windows. (issue #921)
- Theme Editor: Fixed using color picker on secondary screen.
- Fixed detection of Windows 11 if custom exe launcher does not specify Windows
  10+ compatibility in application manifest. (issue #916)
- Linux: Fixed slightly different font size (or letter width) used to paint HTML
  text when default font family is _Cantarell_ (e.g. on Fedora). (issue #912)

#### Other Changes

- Class `FlatPropertiesLaf` now supports FlatLaf macOS themes as base themes.


## 3.5.2

#### Fixed bugs

- Windows: Fixed repaint issues (ghosting) on some systems (probably depending
  on graphics card/driver). This is done by setting Java system property
  `sun.java2d.d3d.onscreen` to `false` (but only if `sun.java2d.d3d.onscreen`,
  `sun.java2d.d3d` and `sun.java2d.noddraw` are not yet set), which disables
  usage of Windows Direct3D (DirectX) onscreen surfaces. Component rendering
  still uses Direct3D. (issue #887)
- FlatLaf window decorations:
  - Iconify/maximize/close buttons did not fill whole title bar height, if some
    custom component in menu bar increases title bar height. (issue #897)
  - Windows: Fixed possible application freeze when using custom component that
    overrides `Component.contains(int x, int y)` and invokes
    `SwingUtilities.convertPoint()` (or similar) from the overridden method.
    (issue #878)
- TextComponents: Fixed too fast scrolling in multi-line text components when
  using touchpads (e.g. on macOS). (issue #892)
- ToolBar: Fixed endless loop if button in Toolbar has focus and is made
  invisible. (issue #884)

#### Other Changes

- FlatLaf window decorations: Added client property `JRootPane.titleBarHeight`
  to allow specifying a (larger) preferred height for the title bar. (issue
  #897)
- Added system property `flatlaf.useRoundedPopupBorder` to allow disabling
  native rounded popup borders on Windows 11 and macOS. On macOS 14.4+, where
  rounded popup borders are disabled since FlatLaf 3.5 because of occasional
  problems, you can use this to enable rounded popup borders (at your risk).


## 3.5.1

#### Fixed bugs

- HTML: Fixed occasional cutoff wrapped text when using multi-line text in HTML
  tags `<h1>`...`<h6>`, `<code>`, `<kbd>`, `<big>`, `<small>` or `<samp>`.
  (issue #873; regression in 3.5)
- Popup: Fixed `UnsupportedOperationException: PERPIXEL_TRANSLUCENT translucency
  is not supported` exception on Haiku OS when showing popup (partly) outside of
  window. (issue #869)
- HiDPI: Fixed occasional wrong repaint areas when using
  `HiDPIUtils.installHiDPIRepaintManager()`. (see PR #864)
- Added system property `flatlaf.useSubMenuSafeTriangle` to allow disabling
  submenu safe triangle (PR #490) for
  [SWTSwing](https://github.com/Chrriis/SWTSwing). (issue #870)


## 3.5

#### New features and improvements

- Table: Support rounded selection. (PR #856)
- Button and ToggleButton: Added border colors for pressed and selected states.
  (issue #848)
- Label: Support painting background with rounded corners. (issue #842)
- Popup: Fixed flicker of popups (e.g. tooltips) while they are moving (e.g.
  following mouse pointer). (issues #832 and #672)
- FileChooser: Wrap shortcuts in scroll pane. (issue #828)
- Theme Editor: On macOS, use larger window title bar. (PR #779)

#### Fixed bugs

- macOS: Disabled rounded popup border (see PR #772) on macOS 14.4+ because it
  may freeze the application and crash the macOS WindowServer process (reports
  vary from Finder restarts to OS restarts). This is a temporary change until a
  solution is found. See NetBeans issues
  [apache/netbeans#7560](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/7560#issuecomment-2226439215)
  and
  [apache/netbeans#6647](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6647#issuecomment-2070124442).
- FlatLaf window decorations: Window top border on Windows 10 in "full window
  content" mode was not fully repainted when activating or deactivating window.
  (issue #809)
- Button and ToggleButton: UI properties `[Toggle]Button.selectedForeground` and
  `[Toggle]Button.pressedForeground` did not work for HTML text. (issue #848)
- HTML: Fixed font sizes for HTML tags `<h1>`...`<h6>`, `<code>`, `<kbd>`,
  `<big>`, `<small>` and `<samp>` in HTML text for components Button, CheckBox,
  RadioButton, MenuItem (and subclasses), JideLabel, JideButton, JXBusyLabel and
  JXHyperlink. Also fixed for Label and ToolTip if using Java 11+.
- ScrollPane: Fixed/improved border painting at 125% - 175% scaling to avoid
  different border thicknesses. (issue #743)
- Table: Fixed painting of alternating rows below table if auto-resize mode is
  `JTable.AUTO_RESIZE_OFF` and table width is smaller than scroll pane (was not
  updated when table width changed and was painted on wrong side in
  right-to-left component orientation).
- Theme Editor: Fixed occasional empty window on startup on macOS.
- FlatLaf window decorations: Fixed black line sometimes painted on top of
  (native) window border on Windows 11. (issue #852)
- HiDPI: Fixed incomplete component paintings at 125% or 175% scaling on Windows
  where sometimes a 1px wide area at the right or bottom component edge is not
  repainted. E.g. ScrollPane focus indicator border. (issues #860 and #582)

#### Incompatibilities

- ProgressBar: Log warning (including stack trace) when uninstalling
  indeterminate progress bar UI or using `JProgressBar.setIndeterminate(false)`
  not on AWT thread, because this may throw NPE in `FlatProgressBarUI.paint()`.
  (issues #841 and #830)
- Panel: Rounded background of panel with rounded corners is now painted even if
  panel is not opaque. (issue #840)


## 3.4.1

#### Fixed bugs

- SplitPane: Update divider when client property `JSplitPane.expandableSide`
  changed.
- TabbedPane: Fixed swapped back and forward scroll buttons when using
  `TabbedPane.scrollButtonsPlacement = trailing` (regression in FlatLaf 3.3).
- Fixed missing window top border on Windows 10 in "full window content" mode.
  (issue #809)
- Extras:
  - `FlatSVGIcon` color filters now support linear gradients. (PR #817)
  - `FlatSVGIcon`: Use log level `CONFIG` instead of `SEVERE` and allow
    disabling logging. (issue #823)
  - Added support for `JSplitPane.expandableSide` client property to
    `FlatSplitPane`.
- Native libraries: Added API version check to test whether native library
  matches the JAR (bad builds could e.g. ship a newer JAR with an older
  incompatible native library) and to test whether native methods can be invoked
  (some security software allows loading native library but blocks method
  invocation).
- macOS: Fixed crash when running in WebSwing. (issue #826; regression in 3.4)

#### Incompatibilities

- File names of custom properties files for nested Laf classes now must include
  name of enclosing class name. E.g. nested Laf class `IntelliJTheme.ThemeLaf`
  used `ThemeLaf.properties` in previous versions, but now needs to be named
  `IntelliJTheme$ThemeLaf.properties`.


## 3.4

#### New features and improvements

- FlatLaf window decorations (Windows 10/11 and Linux): Support "full window
  content" mode, which allows you to extend the content into the window title
  bar. (PR #801)
- macOS: Support larger window title bar close/minimize/zoom buttons spacing in
  [full window content](https://www.formdev.com/flatlaf/macos/#full_window_content)
  mode and introduced "buttons placeholder". (PR #779)
- Native libraries:
  - System property `flatlaf.nativeLibraryPath` now supports loading native
    libraries named the same as on Maven central.
  - Published `flatlaf-<version>-no-natives.jar` to Maven Central. This JAR is
    equal to `flatlaf-<version>.jar`, except that it does not contain the
    FlatLaf native libraries. The Maven "classifier" to use this JAR is
    `no-natives`. You need to distribute the FlatLaf native libraries with your
    application.
    See https://www.formdev.com/flatlaf/native-libraries/ for more details.
  - Improved log messages for loading fails.
- Fonts: Updated **Inter** to
  [v4.0](https://github.com/rsms/inter/releases/tag/v4.0).
- Table: Select all text in cell editor when starting editing using `F2` key on
  Windows or Linux. (issue #652)

#### Fixed bugs

- macOS: Setting window background (of undecorated window) to translucent color
  (alpha < 255) did not show the window translucent. (issue #705)
- JIDE CommandMenuBar: Fixed `ClassCastException` when JIDE command bar displays
  `JideMenu` in popup. (PR #794)


## 3.3

#### New features and improvements

- macOS (10.14+): Popups (`JPopupMenu`, `JComboBox`, `JToolTip`, etc.) now use
  native macOS rounded borders. (PR #772; issue #715)
- Native libraries: Added `libflatlaf-macos-arm64.dylib` and
  `libflatlaf-macos-x86_64.dylib`. See also
  https://www.formdev.com/flatlaf/native-libraries/.
- ScrollPane: Support rounded border. (PR #713)
- SplitPane: Support divider hover and pressed background colors. (PR #788)
- TabbedPane: Support vertical tabs. (PR #758, issue #633)
- TabbedPane: Paint rounded tab area background for rounded cards. (issue #717)
- ToolBar: Added styling properties `separatorWidth` and `separatorColor`.

#### Fixed bugs

- Button and ToggleButton: Selected buttons did not use explicitly set
  foreground color. (issue #756)
- FileChooser: Catch NPE in Java 21 when getting icon for `.exe` files that use
  default Windows exe icon. (see
  [JDK-8320692](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8320692))
- OptionPane: Fixed styling custom panel background in `JOptionPane`. (issue
  #761)
- ScrollPane: Styling ScrollPane border properties did not work if view
  component is a Table.
- Table:
  - Switching theme looses table grid and intercell spacing. (issues #733 and
    #750)
  - Fixed background of `boolean` columns when using alternating row colors.
    (issue #780)
  - Fixed border arc of components in complex table cell editors. (issue #786)
- TableHeader:
  - No longer temporary replace header cell renderer while painting. This avoids
    a `StackOverflowError` in case that custom renderer does this too. (see
    [NetBeans issue #6835](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/issues/6835)) This
    also improves compatibility with custom table header implementations.
  - Header cell renderer background/foreground colors were not restored after
    hover if renderer uses `null` for background/foreground. (PR #790)
- TabbedPane:
  - Avoid unnecessary repainting whole tabbed pane content area when layouting
    leading/trailing components.
  - Avoid unnecessary repainting of selected tab on temporary changes.
  - Fixed "endless" layouting and repainting when using nested tabbed panes (top
    and bottom tab placement) and RSyntaxTextArea (with enabled line-wrapping)
    as tab content. (see
    [jadx issue #2030](https://github.com/skylot/jadx/issues/2030))
- Fixed broken rendering after resizing window to minimum size and then
  increasing size again. (issue #767)

#### Incompatibilities

- Removed support for JetBrains custom decorations, which required
  [JetBrains Runtime](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime/wiki) (JBR)
  8 or 11. It did not work for JBR 17. System property
  `flatlaf.useJetBrainsCustomDecorations` is now ignored. **Note**: FlatLaf
  window decorations continue to work with JBR.


## 3.2.5

#### Fixed bugs

- Popup: Fixed NPE if popup invoker is `null` on Windows 10. (issue #753;
  regression in 3.2.1 in fix for #626)


## 3.2.4

#### Fixed bugs

- Popup: Fixed NPE if popup invoker is `null` on Linux with Wayland and Java 21.
  (issue #752; regression in 3.2.3)


## 3.2.3

#### Fixed bugs

- Popup: Popups that request focus were not shown on Linux with Wayland and Java 21.
  (issue #752)


## 3.2.2

#### Fixed bugs

- Button: Fixed painting icon and text at wrong location when using HTML text,
  left/right vertical alignment and running in Java 19+. (issue #746)
- CheckBox and RadioButton: Fixed cut off right side when border is removed and
  horizontal alignment is set to `right`. (issue #734)
- TabbedPane: Fixed NPE when using focusable component as tab component and
  switching theme. (issue #745)


## 3.2.1

#### Fixed bugs

- Fixed memory leak in
  `MultiResolutionImageSupport.create(int,Dimension[],Function<Dimension,Image>)`,
  which caches images created by the producer function. Used by
  `FlatSVGIcon.getImage()` and `FlatSVGUtils.createWindowIconImages()`. If you
  use one of these methods, it is **strongly recommended** to upgrade to this
  version, because if the returned image is larger and painted very often it may
  result in an out-of-memory situation. (issue #726)
- FileChooser: Fixed occasional NPE in `FlatShortcutsPanel` on Windows. (issue
  #718)
- TextField: Fixed placeholder text painting, which did not respect horizontal
  alignment property of `JTextField`. (issue #721)
- Popup: Fixed drop shadow if popup overlaps a heavyweight component. (Windows
  10 only; issue #626)


## 3.2

#### New features and improvements

- TabbedPane: Support rounded underline selection and rounded card tabs. (PR
  #703)
- FlatLaf window decorations:
  - Support for Windows on ARM 64-bit. (issue #443, PR #707)
  - Support toolbox-style "small" window title bar. (issue #659, PR #702)
- Extras: Class `FlatSVGIcon` now uses [JSVG](https://github.com/weisJ/jsvg)
  library (instead of svgSalamander) for rendering. JSVG provides improved SVG
  rendering and uses less memory compared to svgSalamander. (PR #684)
- ComboBox: Improved location of selected item in popup if list is large and
  scrollable.
- FileChooser: Show localized text for all locales supported by Java's Metal
  look and feel. (issue #680)
- Added system property `flatlaf.useNativeLibrary` to allow disabling loading of
  FlatLaf native library. (issue #674)
- IntelliJ Themes:
  - Reduced memory footprint by releasing Json data and ignoring IntelliJ UI
    properties that are not used in FlatLaf.
  - Updated "Hiberbee Dark" and "Gradianto" themes.

#### Fixed bugs

- Styling: Fixed scaling of some styling properties (`rowHeight` for Table and
  Tree; `iconTextGap` for Button, CheckBox and RadioButton). (issue #682)
- Fixed `IllegalComponentStateException` when invoker is not showing in
  `SubMenuUsabilityHelper`. (issue #692)
- macOS themes: Changing `@accentColor` variable in FlatLaf properties files did
  not change all accent related colors for all components.
- IntelliJ Themes:
  - "Light Owl" theme: Fixed wrong (unreadable) text color in selected menu
    items, selected text in text components, and selection in ComboBox popup
    list. (issue #687)
  - "Gradianto Midnight Blue" theme: Fixed color of ScrollBar track, which was
    not visible. (issue #686)
  - "Monocai" theme: Fixed unreadable text color of default buttons. (issue
    #693)
  - "Vuesion" theme: Fixed foreground colors of disabled text.
  - "Material UI Lite" themes: Fixed non-editable ComboBox button background.
  - CheckBox and RadioButton: Fixed unselected icon colors for themes "Atom One
    Light", "Cyan Light", "GitHub", "Light Owl", "Material Lighter" and
    "Solarized Light".
  - TabbedPane: Fixed focused tab background color for themes "Arc *", "Material
    Design Dark", "Monocai", "One Dark", "Spacegray" and "Xcode-Dark". (issue
    #697)
  - TextComponents, ComboBox and Spinner: Fixed background colors of enabled
    text components, to distinguish from disabled, for themes "Carbon", "Cobalt
    2", "Gradianto *", "Gruvbox *", "Monocai", "Spacegray", "Vuesion",
    "Xcode-Dark", "GitHub", and "Light Owl". (issue #528)
  - Fixed wrong disabled text colors in "Dark Flat", "Hiberbee Dark", "Light
    Flat", "Nord", "Solarized Dark" and "Solarized Light" themes.
  - Fixed colors for selection background/foreground, Separator, Slider track
    and ProgressBar background in various themes.
- Native Windows libraries: Fixed crash when running in Java 8 and newer Java
  version is installed in `PATH` environment variable and using class
  `SystemInfo` before AWT initialization. (issue #673)
- ComboBox: Fixed search in item list for text with spaces. (issue #691)
- FormattedTextField: On Linux, fixed `IllegalArgumentException: Invalid
  location` if `JFormattedTextField.setDocument()` is invoked in a focus gained
  listener on that formatted text field. (issue #698)
- PopupMenu: Make sure that popup menu does not overlap any operating system
  task bar. (issue #701)
- FileChooser: Use system icons on Windows with Java 17.0.3 (and later) 32-bit.
  Only Java 17 - 17.0.2 32-bit do not use system icons because of a bug in Java
  32-bit that crashes the application. (PR #709)
- FileChooser: Fixed crash on Windows with Java 17 to 17.0.2 32-bit. Java 17
  64-bit is not affected. (regression since FlatLaf 2.3; PR #522, see also issue
  #403)

#### Incompatibilities

- Extras: Class `FlatSVGIcon` now uses [JSVG](https://github.com/weisJ/jsvg)
  library for SVG rendering. You need to replace svgSalamander with JSVG in your
  build scripts and distribute `jsvg.jar` with your application. Also replace
  `com.kitfox.svg` with `com.github.weisj.jsvg` in `module-info.java` files.
- IntelliJ Themes: Removed all "Contrast" themes from "Material UI Lite".


## 3.1.1

- IntelliJ Themes:
  - Fixed too large menu item paddings and too large table/tree row heights (all
    "Material Theme UI Lite" themes; issue #667; regression in FlatLaf 3.1).
  - Fixed too large tree row height in "Carbon", "Dark Purple", "Gray",

  component border so that it can paint within the whole component. Also
  increase combo box size if a custom renderer uses a border with insets that
  are larger than the default combo box padding (`2,6,2,6`).
- Fixed component heights at `1.25x`, `1.75x` and `2.25x` scaling factors (Java
  8 only) so that Button, ComboBox, Spinner and TextField components (including

  - If desktop pane is resized, layout of dock is updated.
- TableHeader: Moved table header column border painting from
  `FlatTableHeaderUI` to new border `FlatTableHeaderBorder` to improve
  compatibility with custom table header implementations. (issue #228)

    dialogs. (issue #315)
  - Fixed broken maximizing window (under special conditions) when restoring
    frame state at startup.
  - Title icon: For multi-resolution images now use `getResolutionVariant(width,
    height)` (instead of `getResolutionVariants()`) to allow creation of
    requested size on demand. This also avoids creation of all resolution
    variants.
  - Double-click at upper-left corner of maximized frame did not close window.
    (issue #326)
- Linux: Fixed/improved detection of user font settings. (issue #309)
